This is my Holy Bible, this is my way
Your living Word guides me every day

Your promises restore my youth
Your light shines brighter than my fear
Your voice is gentle, strong, and clear
In Your Word, Lord, I draw near

Song 2 — Show Me the Truth

Lead me by Your holy rod
When I am lost, You make me see
Your Word brings life and liberty
Your Spirit teaches my heart to stand
I place my life in Your hand
Jesus, lead me through this land

Song 3 — My God Holds Me

My God holds me when I fall
Your grace is greater than it all
In every trial, You stay near
You turn my weakness into cheer
Your arms are strong to carry me
Your love sets my spirit free
In Your care, I will always be

Song 4 — Peace in Every Trial

In every trial, You give me peace
Your mercy makes my worries cease
When storms arise, You calm my soul
Your perfect will is my true goal
Your presence is my hiding place
I rest secure in Your embrace
Jesus, I trust Your saving grace

Song 5 — Blessings From Above

Blessings from heaven, falling on me
Your goodness flows like a mighty sea
Every breath is a gift from You
Your love is faithful, pure, and true
You crown my life with favor and light
You guide my steps both day and night
Lord, You make all things right

Song 6 — Light for My Path

Your Word is light upon my way
A lamp to guide me day by day
When darkness tries to hide my sight
Your truth shines strong and bright
I walk by faith and not by fear
Your voice is the one I hear
Lord, Your presence draws me near

This is my way in Jesus’ name
Your love will never be the same
You changed my heart, You healed my soul
You made me clean and fully whole
I lift my hands and worship You
In all I am, You make me new
My life is Yours, forever true
